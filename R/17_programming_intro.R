## 17.1 Introduction ------

## 16.1.1 Prerequisites 

# This chapter will focus on the lubridate package. 
# lubridate is not part of the core tidyverse, so we need to load it explicitly:

library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)

library(nycflights13) # data




# Programming is a cross-cutting skill needed for all data science work.

# Programming produces code, and code is a tool of communication -- 
# with others and with your future self. 
# - Simplicity and transparency are key virtues of good code. 
# - As with writing in general, rewriting is the key to clarity.

## 4 chapters: 

## 1. Pipes: ---- 
## http://r4ds.had.co.nz/pipes.html#pipes 

#  Learn how to use the pipe, %>%, how it works, 
#  what the alternatives are, and when not to use it.

## 2. Functions: ---- 
## http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html#functions 

# Abstracting actions and avoiding repetitions in code: 
# Learn how to write functions which let you extract out 
# repeated code so that it can be easily reused.

## 3. Vectors and other data structures: ---- 
## http://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html 

# For more advanced programming, we need a solid grounding
# in Râ€™s data structures: 
# - 4 common atomic vectors, 
# - 3 important S3 classes built on top of them, 
# - the list and 
# - the data frame.


## 4. Iteration: ---- 
## http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html 

# Doing things repeatedly: 
# Functions extract out repeated code, but we often need to repeat the same
# actions on different inputs: Tools for iteration that us you do
# similar things again and again:  
# - for loops and 
# - functional programming



## 17.1 Learning more ----- 

# To learn more you need to study R as a programming language, 
# not just an interactive environment for data science.

## Book recommendations: 

# - "Hands on Programming with R", by Garrett Grolemund.
#    (see PDF)

# - "Advanced R" by Hadley Wickham.
