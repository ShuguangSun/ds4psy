## Preparations

Create an R script (`.R`) or an R-Markdown file (`.Rmd`) and load the R packages of the **tidyverse**. (**Hint:** Structure your script by inserting spaces, meaningful comments, and sections.) 

```{r layout_template, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## Iteration | ds4psy
## 2019 01 31
## ----------------------------

## Preparations: ----------

library(tidyverse)

## 1. Topic: ----------

# etc.

## End of file (eof). ----------  
```

To use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), create a corresponding file and save it with the `.Rmd` extension (e.g., by selecting `File > New File > R Markdown`). 
For instructions on combining text and code, see [Chapter 27: R Markdown](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) of our textbook, or use one of the following templates:  

- minimal template:  `rmd_template_s` [in [.Rmd](http://rpository.com/down/temp/rmd_template_s.Rmd) | [.html](http://rpository.com/down/temp/rmd_template_s.html) format]

- medium template: `rmd_template_m` [in [.Rmd](http://rpository.com/down/temp/rmd_template_m.Rmd) | [.html](http://rpository.com/down/temp/rmd_template_m.html) format]

- explicit explanations: `Rmarkdown_basics` [in [.Rmd](http://rpository.com/down/temp/Rmarkdown_basics.Rmd) | [.html](http://rpository.com/down/temp/Rmarkdown_basics.html) format]

**Hint:** Try to _knit_ your `.Rmd` file immediately after saving it and marvel at the beauty of the resulting `.html`-file. If this works, keep doing this routinely from now on, putting all your R-code into code chunks, and any text (like headings or conclusions) that describes or explains what you are doing outside of them. From now on, you can share your `.html` output files, rather than your `.Rmd` source files when showing off your R and data science skills.

# Iteration

Defining _iteration_ := doing things repeatedly. 
The repetition of a procedure or process. 

## Loops

```{r create_data_tb, echo = FALSE, eval = TRUE}
# Create data with numeric columns:
set.seed(100)
N <- 100

id <- 1:N

age <- round(rnorm(N, 25, 8), 0)
age[age < 18] <- (age[age < 18] + 8)

height <- round(rnorm(N, 178, 15), 0)
height[height < 148] <- (height[height < 148] + 4)
height[height > 195] <- (height[height > 195] - 5)

shoesize <- round(rnorm(N, 38, 4), 0)
shoesize[shoesize < 32] <- (shoesize[shoesize < 32] + 2)
shoesize[shoesize < 34] <- (shoesize[shoesize < 34] + 1)
shoesize[shoesize > 42] <- (shoesize[shoesize > 43] - 1)
shoesize[shoesize > 45] <- (shoesize[shoesize > 46] - 2)

# Correlation: shoesize & height: 
shoesize[height < 157] <- (shoesize[height < 157] - 3)
shoesize[height < 164] <- (shoesize[height < 164] - 2)
shoesize[height < 171] <- (shoesize[height < 171] - 1)
shoesize[height > 198] <- (shoesize[height > 198] + 4)
shoesize[height > 192] <- (shoesize[height > 192] + 3)
shoesize[height > 185] <- (shoesize[height > 185] + 2)
shoesize[height > 179] <- (shoesize[height > 179] + 1)

IQ <- round(rnorm(N, 105, 12), 0)
IQ[IQ < 81] <- (IQ[IQ < 81] + 6)
IQ[IQ < 85] <- (IQ[IQ < 85] + 4)
IQ[IQ < 92] <- (IQ[IQ < 92] + 2)

# Tibble:
tb <- tibble(id, age, height, shoesize, IQ)
head(tb)

## Correlation: shoesize ~ height: 
# plot(tb$shoesize ~ tb$height)
# abline(lm(shoesize ~ height, tb), col = "red")

## Correlation: IQ ~ height: 
# plot(tb$IQ ~ tb$height)
# abline(lm(IQ ~ height, tb), col = "green3")

## Write out table:
# write_csv2(tb, path = "../data/tb.csv")

## Read in table again:
# read_csv2("../data/tb.csv")
```

### Using a `for` loop

Asking and answering 3 questions:

1. _body_: What is the task performed in the loop?

2. _sequence_: Over which sequence should be iterated? _How many_ iterations are there?

3. _output_: What is the _result_ of the loop: What _type_ of object and _how many_ instances? 

After answering these questions, a loop can be designed in reverse order (from output to body):

```{r for-loop-template, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# (a) prepare output: 
output <- vector(<type>, length(start:end))  

# (b) for loop: 
for (i in start:end} {                    # sequence
  
  result_i <- <solve task for i-th case>  # body: solve task
  output[[i]] <- result_i                 #       collect results in output

}

# (c) use output: 
output  
```

#### Loops for iteration

Assuming we know how often we want to do something. 

Example: Compute square number of integers from 1 to 10.

1. _body_: Square of some number `i`.
2. _sequence_: `i` from 1 to 10.
3. _output_: A vector of 10 numbers.

Implementation:

```{r for-loop-demo-1}
# (a) prepare output: 
output <- vector("double", length(1:10))

# (b) for loop: 
for (i in 1:10) {
  
  sq <- i^2
  print(paste0("i = ", i, ": sq = ", sq))  # for debugging
  output[[i]] <- sq
  
}

# (c) use output: 
output  
```

**Note:** In the loop, we use `output[[i]]`, rather than `output[i]` to refer to the `i`-th element of `output` . 
Actually, using a single `[]` would have worked as well, but the double `[[]]` makes it clear that we want to remove a level of the hierarchy and 
assign something to a single element of `output`. 
(See [Ch. 20.5.2 Subsetting recursive vectors (lists)](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/vectors.html#subsetting-1) for more details on this distinction.) 

#### Loops over data

In the context of data science, we often want to iterate over (rows or columns) of data tables. 
Let's load some data to work with:

```{r load_data_for_loop}
## Load data:
# tb <- read_csv2("../data/tb.csv")  # from local file
tb <- read_csv2("http://rpository.com/ds4psy/data/tb.csv")  # from local file

# inspect tb: 
dim(tb)  # 100 cases x 5 variables
head(tb)
```

Suppose we wanted to obtain the means of the variables from `age` to `IQ`. 
We could call the `mean` function for each descired variable. Thus, repeating this call for each variable would be:

```{r multiple_means}
# (a) Means: ---- 
mean(tb$age)
mean(tb$height)
mean(tb$shoesize)
mean(tb$IQ)
```

However, the statement "for each variable" in the previous sentence shows that we are dealing with an instance of _iteration_ here. 
When dealing with computers, _repetition_ of identical steps or commands is a signal that there are more efficient ways to accomplish the same task. 

How could we use a for loop here? To design this loop, we need to answer our 3 questions from above: 

1. _body_: We want to compute the mean of 4 columns (`age` to `IQ`) in `tb`.

2. _sequence_: We want to iterate over columns 2 to 5 (i.e., 4 iterations). 

3. _output_: The _result_ or the loop is a vector of type "double", containing 4 elements. 

Note: 

- We remove the 1st column, as no computation is needed for it.

- The i-th column of tibble `tb` (or data frame `df`) can be accessed via `tb[[i]]` (or `df[[i]]`). 

```{r loop_means_1}
# Prepare data: 
tb_2 <- tb %>% select(-1)
tb_2

# (a) prepare output: 
output <- vector("double", 4)

# (b) for loop: 
for (i in 1:4){
  
  mn <- mean(tb_2[[i]])
  
  output[[i]] <- mn
  
}

# (c) use output: 
output
```

In the **tidyverse** the loop range can be defined with a special function: 

```{r}
seq_along(tb_2)  # loop through COLUMNS of a df/table
```

#### Practice {-}

1. Rewrite the for loop to compute the means of columns 2 to 5 of `tb` (i.e., without simplifying `tb` to `tb_2` first). 

#### Solution {-}

We create a new output vector `output_2` and need to change 2 things: 

- the column numbers of the for loop statement (from `1:4` to `2:5`). 

- the index to which we assign our current mean `mn` should be decreased to `i - 1` (to assign the mean of column 2 to the 1st element of `output_2`). 

```{r loop_means_2}
# Using data:
# tb

# (a) prepare output: 
output_2 <- vector("double", 4)

# (b) for loop: 
for (i in 2:5){
  
  mn <- mean(tb[[i]])
  
  output_2[[i - 1]] <- mn
  
}

# (c) use output: 
output_2

# Verify equality: 
all.equal(output, output_2)
```

2. We have learned that creating a for loop requires knowing (a)&nbsp;the data type of the loop results and 
(b)&nbsp;a data structure than can collect these results. 
This is simple and straightforward if each loop results in a single number, as then all results can be stored in a vector. 

However, things get more complicated if loops yield tables, lists, or plots, as outputs. 
Try creating similar for loops that return the `summary` and a histogram (using the **base** R function `hist`) of each variable in `tb` (or each variable of `tb_2`). 

#### Solution {-}

Creating a `summary`: 

```{r practice-summary-1}
# (b) Summary: ---- 
summary(tb$age)
summary(tb$height)
summary(tb$shoesize)
s <- summary(tb$IQ)
s

# What type of object is s?
typeof(s)     # "double"
is.vector(s)  # FALSE
is.table(s)   # TRUE
```

The following for loop is almost identical to the one (computing `mean` of columns 2:5 of `tb`) above. 
However, we initialize the `summaries` vector to a `mode = "list"`, which allows storing more complex objects in a vector: 

```{r practice-summary-2}
# Loop:
# (a) prepare output: 
summaries <- vector(mode = "list", length = 4)  # initialize to a vector of lists!

# (b) for loop: 
for (i in 2:5){
  
  sm <- summary(tb[[i]])
  
  summaries[[i - 1]] <- sm
  
}

# (c) use output: 
summaries  # print summaries:
```

Histogram: 

```{r}
# (c) Histogram: ---- 
hist(tb$age)
hist(tb$height)
hist(tb$shoesize)
h <- hist(tb$IQ)
h

typeof(h) # list

# As loop: 
tb_2
names(tb_2[1])
hist(tb_2[[1]], main = paste0("Histogram of ", names(tb_2[1]), " values:"), xlab = names(tb_2[1]))

# With loop:
out <- vector("list", 4)

for (i in seq_along(tb_2)) {  # loop through COLUMNS of tb_2: 
  
  print(i)
  var_name <- names(tb_2[i])
  title <- paste0("Histogram of ", var_name, " values:")
  x_lab <- var_name
  out[[i]] <- hist(tb_2[[i]], main = title, xlab = x_lab)
  
}

plot(out[[1]])
```


### Variations

We can distinguish between 4 variations of the basic theme of the for loop:

#### 1. Modifying an existing object, instead of creating a new object {-}

Example: Rescale every column of a table (tibble or data frame).

```{r}
set.seed(1)  # for reproducible results

tb <- tibble(
  a = rnorm(10),
  b = rnorm(10),
  c = rnorm(10),
  d = rnorm(10)
)
tb

# Define rescale01 function:
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}
```

(a) In 4 separate steps:

```{r}
df <- tb  # copy

# (a) each column individually:
df$a <- rescale01(df$a)
df$b <- rescale01(df$b)
df$c <- rescale01(df$c)
df$d <- rescale01(df$d)

df
```

(b) Using a loop to modify an existing object:  

Answers to our 3 questions:

1. _body_: apply `rescale01()` to every column of `tb`.

2. _sequence_: A list of columns (i.e., iterate over each column with `seq_along(tb)`).

3. _output_: `tb` (i.e., identical to the input).

```{r}
# (b) loop that modifies an existing object:
df2 <- tb  # copy

for (i in seq_along(df2)) {
  
  df2[[i]] <- rescale01(df2[[i]])
  
}

# Output: 
df2

# Verify equality:
all.equal(df, df2)
```

#### 2. Looping over names or values, instead of indices {-}

So far, we used `for loop` to loop over _numeric indices_ of `x` with `for (i in seq_along(x))`, 
and then extracted the `i`-th value of `x` with `x[[i]]`. 

There are 2 additional common loop patterns:

1. loop over the _elements_ of `x` with `for (x in xs)`: 
useful when only caring about side effects 

2. loop over the _names_ of `x` with `for (nm in names(xs))`: 
useful when names are needed for files or plots.

Whenever creating named output, make sure also provide names to the results vector:

```{r}
x <- 1:3

results <- vector("list", length(x))
names(results) <- names(x)

results
```

Note that the basic iteration over the numeric indices is the most general form, 
because given a position we can extract both the current name and the current value:

```{r}
x <- 1:3

for (i in seq_along(x)) {
  name  <- names(x)[[i]]
  value <- x[[i]]
}
```

#### 3. Handling outputs of unknown length {-}

- Problem: Not knowing how long the output will be. 

For example, imagine we want to simulate some random vectors of random lengths. 

ToDo: [etc.]

#### 4. Handling sequences of unknown length {-}

- Problem: The number of iterations is not known in advance.
- Solution: `while` loop, with a `condition` to stop loop. 

Sometimes we don’t even know how long the input sequence should run for. 
This is common when doing _simulations_. 
For example, we might want to loop until we get three heads in a row. 
We can’t do that sort of iteration with the `for` loop, but can use a `while` loop instead. 

A `while` loop is simpler than `for` loop because it only has 2 components, a condition and a body:

```{r while_loop_structure, eval = FALSE}
while (condition) {
  # body
}
```


## Functional programming

### For loops vs. functionals

In R, `for` loops are not as important as in other languages, because R is a _functional_ programming language. 
This means that it’s possible to replace `for` loops by wrapping up the `for` loop in a function, and call that function.

#### Example 

Consider a simple data table `df`: 

```{r}
# Data:
set.seed(1)  # for reproducible results

df <- tibble(a = rnorm(10),
             b = rnorm(10),
             c = rnorm(10),
             d = rnorm(10)
)

df
```

Assume that our goal is getting the mean of every column. 
The standard solution is using a `for` loop:

```{r}
# loop:
output <- vector("double", length(df))

# for loop over columns i: 
for (i in seq_along(df)) {
  
  output[[i]] <- mean(df[[i]])

}

output
```

As we will want to compute the means of every column pretty frequently, we extract it into a function:

```{r}
col_mean <- function(data) {
  
  output <- vector("double", length(data))
  
  for (i in seq_along(data)) {
    
    output[i] <- mean(data[[i]])  # apply function to i-th column of df
    
  }
  
  output
}

# Check: 
col_mean(df)
```

But now we also want the _median_ and _standard deviation_ of every column. 
Of course we could write analog functions `col_median()` and `col_sd()`, 
but they would only differ in 1 lines from `col_mean` above. 

#### Motivation: Generalising functions

What would we do if we saw a set of functions like this:

```{r}
f1 <- function(x) abs(x - mean(x)) ^ 1
f2 <- function(x) abs(x - mean(x)) ^ 2
f3 <- function(x) abs(x - mean(x)) ^ 3
```

Hopefully, we’d notice that there’s a lot of duplication, 
and extract it into an _additional argument_ to a more general function:

```{r}
f <- function(x, i) abs(x - mean(x)) ^ i
```

By doing this, we’ve reduced the chance of bugs (because you now have 1/3 of the original code), 
and made it easier to generalise to new situations.

#### Application: Using functions as arguments to functions

We can do exactly the same thing with `col_mean()`, `col_median()`, and `col_sd()` 
by adding an argument that supplies the _function_ to apply to each column:

```{r}
col_summary <- function(data, fun) {
  
  out <- vector("double", length(data))
  
  for (i in seq_along(data)) {
    
    out[i] <- fun(data[[i]])  # !!!
    
  }
  
  out

  }

# Repeat use of col_mean (from above): 
col_summary(df, fun = mean) # Note: same functionality/results as above.

# New uses: 
col_summary(df, fun = median)
col_summary(df, fun = sd)
```

The idea of passing a _function_ as an _argument_ to another _function_ is an extremely powerful idea, 
and it’s one of the behaviors that makes R a _functional programming language_.


## Replacing loops by `apply` and **purrr**

The `apply` family of functions and the **purrr** package provide functions that eliminate the need for many `for` loops.  

Note that using `apply` and `map` is not necessarily faster than using `for` loops. 
The chief benefit of using these functions is not speed, but _clarity_: They make code easier to write and read.

### Using `apply`

The `base::apply` family of functions in (i.e., `apply`, `lapply`, `tapply`, etc.) 
solve this problem by allowing to apply a function to designated parts of a data structure.

`apply` takes the following arguments: 

- `X` argument takes an array or matrix (i.e., data);
- `MARGIN` argument: `1` = rows, `2` = columns;
- `FUN` is the function to be applied. 

Example: Using `base::apply` to solve the problem above:

```{r apply}
dim(df)  # 10 rows, 4 columns:

# apply FUN to columns:
apply(X = df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean)    # mean of every column
apply(X = df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = median)  # median of every column
apply(X = df, MARGIN = 2, FUN = sd)      # SD of every column

# apply FUN to rows:
apply(X = df, MARGIN = 1, FUN = mean)    # mean of every row
apply(X = df, MARGIN = 1, FUN = median)  # median of every row
apply(X = df, MARGIN = 1, FUN = sd)      # SD of every row
```

Note: 

- `lapply` returns a _list_ of the same length as `X`, 
each element of which is the result of applying `FUN` to the corresponding element of `X`.

- See also `sapply` and `vapply` for simplifying arrays and returning vectors. 

### Using **purrr**

The **purrr** package provides modern and more consistent versions of `apply`. 

The main goal of using **purrr** functions (instead of `for` loops) is to allow breaking common list manipulation challenges into independent pieces. 

This strategy involves 2 steps, each of which scales down the problem: 

1. Solving the problem for a _single element_ of the list.  
Once we’ve solved that problem, **purrr** takes care of generalising the solution to every element in the list.

2. Breaking a complex problem down into _smaller sub-problems_ that allow us to advance towards a solution.  
With **purrr**, we get many small pieces that we can compose together with the pipe (`%>%`).

This scaling-down strategy makes it easier to solve new problems and to understand our solutions to old problems when we re-read older code.


### `map` functions

The pattern of looping over a vector, doing something to each element and saving the results is so common that the **purrr** package provides a family of functions for it. 
There is a function for each type of output:

- `map()` makes a _list_.
- `map_lgl()` makes a _logical vector_.
- `map_int()` makes an _integer vector_.
- `map_dbl()` makes a _double vector_.
- `map_chr()` makes a _character vector_.

Each function takes a vector `.x` as input, applies a function `.f` to each element, and then returns a new vector that’s the same length (and has the same names) as the input.   
The type of the output vector is determined by the suffix to the map function.

#### Examples 

Using map on the above example (with doubles as output):

```{r map_dbl_1}
map_dbl(.x = df, .f = mean)
map_dbl(df, median)
map_dbl(df, sd)
```

Notes: 

- Without the suffix `_dbl`,  `map(df, sd)` returns a list (with an element for every column of `df`). 

- With `map`, our focus is on the function/operation, not the bookkeeping of the `for` loop. 
This is even more obvious when using the pipe: 

```{r map_dbl_pipe}
df %>% map_dbl(mean)
df %>% map_dbl(median)
df %>% map_dbl(sd)
```

- `map` also uses the generic `...` argument to allow for additional arguments:

```{r map_dotdotdot}
map_dbl(df, mean, trim = 0.5)
map_dbl(df, sd, na.rm = FALSE)
```

- `map` preserves names:

```{r}
z <- list(x = 1:3, y = 4:5)
z %>% map_int(length)
```


#### Shortcuts

There are a few shortcuts to save typing in the `.f` argument of `map`. 

Imagine we want to fit a linear model to each group in a dataset. 

The following example splits the up the `mtcars` dataset in to 3 pieces (by value of cylinder) 
and fits the same linear model to each piece. 
The linear model is supplied as an _anonymous function_: 

```{r map_split_anon_fun}
mtcars %>%
  group_by(cyl) %>% 
  count()

models <- mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>%                            # split data into 3 sets (by cyl) 
  map(function(df) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = df))   # map lm function to each set

models # 3 linear models
```

As the syntax for creating an _anonymous function_ in R is quite verbose, **purrr** provides a _one-sided formula_ as a shortcut: 

```{r map_split_shortcut}
models <- mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>% 
  map(~lm(mpg ~ wt, data = .))

models
```

Here, the `.` is used as a pronoun that refers to the current list element. 

When inspecting many models, we may want to extract a summary statistic like $R^{2}$. 
To do that we need to first run `summary()` on our `models` and then extract the component called `r.squared`. 
We could do that using the _shorthand for anonymous functions_:

```{r map_split_map_2}
models %>% 
  map(summary) %>% 
  map_dbl(~.$r.squared)
```

But extracting named components is a common operation, so **purrr** provides an even shorter shortcut: We can use a _string_:

```{r map_split_map_named}
models %>% 
  map(summary) %>% 
  map_dbl("r.squared")
```

Alternatively, we can also use an _integer_ to select elements by position:

```{r map_split_map_number}
x <- list(list(1, 2, 3), 
          list(4, 5, 6), 
          list(7, 8, 9))

x %>% map_dbl(2)  # 2nd column of x
```

### `map` vs. `apply`

The `map` functions of **purrr** are modeled on the `apply` functions:

- `lapply` is basically identical to `map`, except that `map` is consistent with all the other functions in **purrr**, and we can use the shortcuts for `.f`.

- `sapply` is a wrapper around `lapply` that automatically simplifies the output (which can yield unexpected results).

- `vapply` is a safe alternative to `sapply` because you supply an additional argument that defines the type. 
The only problem with `vapply` is that it’s a lot of typing: `vapply(df, is.numeric, logical(1))` is equivalent to `map_lgl(df, is.numeric)`. 


- One advantage of `vapply` over **purrr**’s `map` functions is that it can also produce _matrices_ — the `map` functions only ever produce _vectors_.

# Exercises (WPA10)

Here are the exercises of WPA10 and possible solutions for them.

## Exercise 1

- Look up the term _Fibonacci numbers_ and write a function that uses a for loop to create and return the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

- Use your function to print the first 25 Fibonacci numbers.

#### Solution {-}

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number), a Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence of `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...`. 

For any element $e_{i}$ and $i > 2$, each element is the sum of the 2 preceding elements: 

$e_{i} = e_{i-2} + e_{i-1}$.   

```{r fibonacci}
fibonacci <- function(n){
  
  if (is.na(n) || (n < 1) || (n != round(n)))  {
    stop("n must be a positive integer.")
  }
  
  # initialize the sequence:
  fib <- c(0, 1)
  
  if (n <= 2){
    
    fib <- fib[1:n]
    
  } else {

    # initialize output vector:    
    fib <- c(fib, rep(NA, (n-2)))
    
    # loop:
    for (i in 3:n){
      
      fib[i] <- fib[i-2] + fib[i-1]
      
    } # end for loop.
  } # end if (n > 2).
  
  return(fib)

}

# Check:
fibonacci(1)
fibonacci(2)
fibonacci(3)
fibonacci(4)

# First 25 Fibonacci numbers:
fibonacci(25)

## Errors:
# fibonacci(0)
# fibonacci(-1)
# fibonacci(3/2)
# fibonacci(NA)
```
