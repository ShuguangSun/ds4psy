## Preparations

Create an R script (`.R`) or an R-Markdown file (`.Rmd`) and load the R packages of the `tidyverse`. (**Hint:** Structure your script by inserting spaces, meaningful comments, and sections.) 

```{r layout_template, echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
## Importing data | ds4psy
## 2018 12 17
## ----------------------------

## Preparations: ----------

library(tidyverse)

## 1. Topic: ----------

# etc.

## End of file (eof). ----------  
```

To use [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), create a corresponding file and save it with the `.Rmd` extension (e.g., by selecting `File > New File > R Markdown`). 
For instructions on combining text and code, see [Chapter 27: R Markdown](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) of our textbook, or use one of the following templates:  

- minimal template:  `rmd_template_s` [in [.Rmd](http://rpository.com/down/temp/rmd_template_s.Rmd) | [.html](http://rpository.com/down/temp/rmd_template_s.html) format]

- medium template: `rmd_template_m` [in [.Rmd](http://rpository.com/down/temp/rmd_template_m.Rmd) | [.html](http://rpository.com/down/temp/rmd_template_m.html) format]

- explicit explanations: `Rmarkdown_basics` [in [.Rmd](http://rpository.com/down/temp/Rmarkdown_basics.Rmd) | [.html](http://rpository.com/down/temp/Rmarkdown_basics.html) format]

**Hint:** Try to _knit_ your `.Rmd` file immediately after saving it and marvel at the beauty of the resulting `.html`-file. If this works, keep doing this routinely from now on, putting all your R-code into code chunks, and any text (like headings or conclusions) that describes or explains what you are doing outside of them. From now on, you can share your `.html` output files, rather than your `.Rmd` source files when showing off your R and data science skills.


# Importing data

Where does data (e.g., a _data frame_ or _tibble_) come from? If we don't enter it ourselves (e.g., with the `tibble` or `tribble` commands (see our session on [Tibbles](http://rpository.com/ds4psy/essentials/tibbles.html)) we usually import it from an external source. The scope of such sources is vast and here we only cover the most common candidates: Data that is already stored in text form or other file formats that can easily be coerced into linear or rectangular data structures. 

This session discusses options and potential pitfalls when using the tidyverse package `readr` for data import. `readr` provides a fast and friendly way to read vectors and rectangular data files (like `csv`, `tsv`, and `fwf`).

## File names and paths

An important pre-requisite to loading data is that we are able to orient ourselves on our computer and can navigate or point to the location at which data files may be stored. Two important questions to ask and answer prior to reading or writing data is: 

- Where am I?  
- Where is my data?  

### Working directory

The 1st questions ("Where am I?") addresses the notion of the current _working directory_. 
This is typically the directory on your computer in which you started your R environment, the location of your current R script, or -- if you're working with [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) _projects_ -- the home directory of your current project. Use the function `getwd` to find out your current working directory:  

```{r getwd}
# Get current working directory (wd):
my_wd <- getwd()
my_wd 
```

Note that `getwd` function returns a character string and -- depending on your operating system -- uses either forward slashes (`/`) or backward slashes (`\`) to separate the hierarchy levels of different directories. 

Similarly, the function `setwd` (with its only argument `dir` specifying a string that points to an existing location on your computer) allows changing your current working directory:

```{r setwd}
# Set current working directory:
setwd(my_wd)  # set dir to my_wd (set above)  
getwd()       # still the same wd as above
```

And `list.files()` provides a list of all files and directories in the current working directory:

```{r list.files, eval = FALSE}
# List files and directories in current working directory: 
list.files() 
```

### Importing data

The 2nd question ("Where is my data?") implies that data doesn't necessarily need to be stored at the same location as your current working directory. Let's suppose that you want to load some data file (called `data_t1.csv`), which you downloaded from an online source at <http://rpository.com/ds4psy/data/data_t1.csv>. But rather than saving it in your current working directory `my_wd`, the file `data_t1.csv` was saved in some parallel directory `data`. 
In this case, there are 2 principle ways to load your data file:

1. Change your current working directory to the data directory: 

```{r}
# Get working directory:
my_wd <- getwd()
my_wd  # prints the current wd:

# Change current working directory: 
setwd("/Users/hneth/Desktop/stuff/Dropbox/_code/R/_teachR/ds4psy/data")
getwd()

# Read data from the NEW working directory: 
t1 <- read_csv("data_t1.csv")  # read csv data file

# Return to the original working directory: 
setwd(my_wd)  # setwd to original directory
getwd()       # back in my_wd
```

2. Keep your current working directory, but read the data from a different directory:

```{r}
# Read data from another directory:

# (a) provide absolute/full path of data file:
t2 <- read_csv("/Users/hneth/Desktop/stuff/Dropbox/_code/R/_teachR/ds4psy/data/data_t1.csv")

# (b) provide relative path of data file:
t3 <- read_csv("./../data/data_t1.csv")

# (c) relative to (platform dependent) home directory:
t4 <- read_csv("~/Desktop/stuff/Dropbox/_code/R/_teachR/ds4psy/data/data_t1.csv")

# (d) provide path to the online source of the data file:
t0 <- read_csv("http://rpository.com/ds4psy/data/data_t1.csv")
```

As you see, there are many different ways of pointing to the location of a data file. Due to this flexibility we recommend not changing your working directory to load data, but rather reading the file from a different directory. 

Let's verify that all of the above methods actually loaded the same data:

```{r}
# Check whether t0 to t4 are all equal:
all.equal(t0, t1) & 
all.equal(t1, t2) & 
all.equal(t2, t3) & 
all.equal(t3, t4)
```

### Sharing scripts and data files

To share your R scripts and data files with others it is best to work with an [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) _project_ and store all scripts and files within this project. Alternatively, keep all your R scripts in a specific directory (e.g., called `R`), and read all data files from either the same or some dedicated data directory (e.g., `data`). Importantly, using only _relative_ file paths (i.e., relative to the current script or to the project's working directory) also allows transferring your scripts and data files. By archiving your entire project folder (e.g., as `my_project.zip`, or a folder that includes the subfolders `R` and `data`), you can transfer your archive to another person or computer and the scripts will keep working.

## Parsing vectors

```{r create_data_delim}
set.seed(2)
n <- 100
v1 <- random_symbols(n = n, set = LETTERS, len = 2)
v2 <- round(runif(n = n, min = 18, max = 88), 0)
v3 <- add_whats(vec = random_symbols(n = n, set = as.character(0:9), len = 8), 
                amount = .05, what = -99)

v4 <- add_whats(vec = random_symbols(n = n, set = c(letters, LETTERS), len = 6), 
                amount = .10, what = -77)

tbl <- tibble(ini = v1,
              age = v2,
              tel = as.numeric(v3),
              pwd = v4)
tbl

# Writing out: 
write_delim(tbl, path = "../data/data.dat", delim = ".", na = "NA", col_names = FALSE)

# Reading in:
my_file <- "../data/data.dat"

# Reading back in:

# (a) read_delim: 
data_2 <- read_delim(my_file, delim = ".", 
                     col_names = c("initials", "age", "tel", "pwd"), 
                     na = c("-77", "-99"))
sum(is.na(data_2))
data_2
```

```{r create_data_fwf}
set.seed(3)
n <- 100
v1 <- random_symbols(n = n, set = LETTERS, len = 2)
v2 <- round(runif(n = n, min = 18, max = 80), 0)
v3 <- random_symbols(n = n, set = as.character(0:9), len = 4)
v4 <- random_symbols(n = n, set = c(letters, LETTERS), len = 6)

tbl_2 <- tibble(ini = v1,
                age = v2,
                tel = v3,
                pwd = v4)
tbl_2

# Writing out: 
write_delim(tbl, path = "../data/data_2.dat", delim = ">", na = "NA", col_names = FALSE)

# (b) read_fwf: 
data_2 <- read_fwf(my_file, fwf_cols(ini = c(1, 2), 
                                     age = c(4, 5), 
                                     nr = c(7, 14), 
                                     pwd = c(16, 21)), 
                   na = c("-77", "-99"))

data_2$nr 
# Note: Doesn't work, as NA values (-77 and -99) are of different length
#       than regular values of the same variables. 
```



## Parsing files

## Writing files


## Importing data from other programs

For _rectangular_ data: 

### From Excel (`xls`)

`readxl` reads excel files (both .xls and .xlsx).

### From SPSS (`sav`)

`haven` reads SPSS, Stata, and SAS files.


For _hierarchical_ data: 

Use `jsonlite` for json, and `xml2` for XML. 



# Exercises (WPA06)

<!-- 

## Agenda

**ToDo:**

- Import the same table from different data formats (e.g., US vs. EU)

- Import a table with corrupt variables and values (e.g., "ten" as a number)

- Realize the limitations of rectangular data (e.g., multiple entries per cell, multiple dependent variables, etc.)

--> 

## Exercise 1

1. Find out your current working directory and list all files and folders contained in it. 

```{r ex1_getwd, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
my_wd <- getwd()
my_wd

list.files(my_wd)
```

2. Change your working directory and list all the files and folders in this directory.

```{r ex1_setwd, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
setwd("./../data")
getwd()
list.files()
```

3. Return to your original working directory. 

```{r ex1_setwd_back, echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
setwd(my_wd)
getwd()
```
