## Data science as the art of dealing with data

Data is cheap and ubiquitous. Every shopping trip, phone call, or visit of a web page leaves a trail of data. Apart from raising important issues of privacy, the notion of big data highlights another problem: In an era in which digital information is collected everywhere, we are drowning in data that seems meaningful and valuable, but we often fail to understand. We lack the ability and tools of dealing with data. 

Data science is relevant not only for natural and computer sciences, but also for social sciences, humanities, and even arts. It is partly, but not exclusively a scientific enterprise, but also a skill, art, and craft. 
Like all skills, arts and crafts, it requires special tools, experience in selecting and using them, and an awful lot of practice.

### Learning to play an instrument

Compare data science with learning an instrument (or some sport): You need some special things (e.g., the instrument, various accessories, but also infrastructure) to get started. Once you have all this stuff, you mostly need instruction and lots of practice. (It helps to have talent, but dedicated practice is essential even when you happen to be a genius.) 

Goals: Complete Rtudes, recital at exam, your first concert as final project.

Ultimately, practicing any art, craft or science is also a process of socialization: belonging to a community that shares the same goals, methods, and values.

### Contrast with statistics

There is an overlap between data science and statistics, but they are not the same. 
Statistics is also a mathematical discipline that does not require getting your hands dirty with data. Moreover, statistics mostly quantifies differences and relationships and aims to test effects.

Data science is an essential prerequisite for applied statistics, but does not need statistics to yield meaningful results. Data science is applied descriptive statistics, but with a different main goal: understanding the data, rather than testing effects.

The ability to deal with data in a variety of ways enables new insights (e.g., by visualizing hidden properties and relationships), but also frees the mind for thinking about data.

## Overview

Students of psychology and other social sciences are trained to analyze data. But the data they learn to work with (e.g., in courses on statistics and empirical research methods) is typically provided to them and structured in a (rectangular or "tidy") format that presupposes many steps of data processing regarding the aggregation and spatial layout of variables.  When beginning to collect data from other sources, students tend to struggle with these pre-processing steps which --- even for experienced data scientists --- tend to require more time and effort than choosing and conducting statistical tests. 

This course develops the foundations of data analysis that allow students to collect data from real-world sources and transform and shape such data to conduct reproducible research and answer scientific and practical questions. Although there are many good introductions to data science (e.g., [Grolemund & Wickham, 2016](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/); Zumel & Mount, 2014) they typically do not take into account the special needs -- and often anxieties and reservations -- of psychology students. As social scientists are not computer scientists, we introduce new concepts and commands without assuming a mathematical or computational background. Adopting a task-oriented perspective, we begin with a specific problem and then solve it with some combination of data collection, manipulation, modeling, and visualization.

## Goals

Our main goal is to develop a set of useful skills in analyzing real-world data and conducting reproducible research. Upon completing this course, you will be able to read, transform, analyze, and visualize data of various types. Many interactive exercises will allow students to check their understanding, monitor their progress, and practice their skills.

## Requirements

This course assumes some basic familiarity with statistics and the [R](http://www.r-project.org/) programming language, but enthusiastic programming novices are also welcome. 

## Assessment

Weekly exercises, mid-term test, and/or final project (which may be thesis-related).


## Miscellaneous Hints

### How to succeed in this course

The recipe for succeeding in this course is very similar to succeeding in life in general. 
To become proficient in R, you primarily need two things: curiosity and routine.

1. Curiosity implies motivation, stamina, and fun: 
You want to achieve something (e.g., make a graph) and willing to find out how this can be done, and overcome various obstacles that may appear along the way. Curiosity will allow you to enjoy the efforts invested, rather than removing them. 

2. Routine implies habits, discipline, and lots of practice (i.e., time). Crucially, habitual use of R implies that you develop many organizational skills (e.g., how to name objects, format code, and structure files) that are non-trivial. 


### Warning 

Beware of side effects: Becoming a useR will profoundly transform your thinking --- not just about code, but about the data and problems you are analyzing or visualizing.

Programming (in R or any other language) can be enjoyable, but also has addictive potential. Make sure to take regular breaks and also engage in other activities!
